- Professional python programmer for 2 years
- I love to learn & try new stuff constantly
- All feedback welcome (first presentation)

# What is Hug?

JSON focused webserver that is:

- Radically Simple
- Self documenting
- Clean
- Very Fast

---

# Crazy Simple Syntax

---

this

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'World'
```

---

becomes:

```javascript
{
  404: "The API call you tried to make was not defined...",
  documentation: {
    handlers: {
      /hello: {
        GET: {
          examples: [ "http://localhost:8000/hello" ],
          outputs: {
            format: "JSON (Javascript Serialized Object Notation)",
            content_type: "application/json; charset=utf-8"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

---

## Lets do something a little more challenging

#### (like pass in a parameter)

---

Remember, leave the parsing to the framework and just do the business logic

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text):
    return {'text': text}
```

---

get:

`./echo&text=repeat`

response:

```
{ text: "repeat" }
```

---

# Forget those annoying things like

- mime types
- encoding
- jsonify
- ensuring parameters are there
- parsing strings to numbers
- handling data differently if get/post

---

### Parameter is optional?

hug does what you would expect and makes the api enpoint parameter optional

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text = 'Foobar'):
    return text
```

---

### Force something to be a number?

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text: hug.types.number):
    return text
```

get `http://localhost:8000/echo&text=repeat`

hug responds with an error

get `http://localhost:8000/echo&text=1`

hug says ok!

---

### POSTer child

posting is just a different decorator

```python
import hug

@hug.post('/echo')
def echo_text(text = 'Foobar'):
    return text
```

---

Other goodies:

- versioning
- directives
- performance
- marshmallow schemas

---

### I bet you can't do versions!

oh yes I can!

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo', versions=1)
def echo_text(text: hug.types.number):
    return text
```

`./v1/echo`

#### or pass a list and its valid for multiple versions

---

# Directives

---

# Features/Performance

- single process can handle thousands of connects a second
- based on falcon
- faster than most web frameworks

---

# Marshmallow Type Checking

- mashmallow objects are "first class citizens"
- type checking and sane error responses for free

---
