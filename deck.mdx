# HUG

## your next api, dont hate it!

the business logic is whats important

and where your focus should be

#### by Jim Vogel

---

## spend your time adding value

not:

- ~~parsing~~ 
- ~~encoding~~
- ~~writing boilerplate~~

don't reinvent the wheel

- All feedback welcome (first presentation)

# What is Hug?

web framework focused on building APIs

- Radically Simple
- Self-documenting
- Very Fast
- Talks in JSON

---

# Crazy Simple Syntax

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'World'
```

---

### Example Response
get: `./hello`

```
World
```

---

### Free Documentation
get: `./`

```javascript
{
  404: "The API call you tried to make was not defined...",
  documentation: {
    handlers: {
      /hello: {
        GET: {
          examples: [ "http://localhost:8000/hello" ],
          outputs: {
            format: "JSON (Javascript Serialized Object Notation)",
            content_type: "application/json; charset=utf-8"
 }}}}}}
```

---

## Something a little more challenging

#### (like pass in a parameter)

---

The framework gets out of the way 

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo(text):
    return {'text': text}
```

---

get: `./echo&text=HelloWorld`

response:

```
{ text: "HelloWorld" }
```

---

# self-documenting

404 page documents our api

we can even add clickable links in the documentation by adding examples

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo(text, examples="text=repeat"):
    return {'text': text}
```

---

# HUGs got you covered

you can forget

- mime types
- encoding
- jsonify
- ensuring parameters are there
- parsing strings to numbers
- handling data differently if get/post

---

### Function Parameter is optional?

hug makes the api endpoint parameter optional as well

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text = 'Foobar'):
    return text
```

---

### Force something to be a number?

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text: hug.types.number):
    return text
```

get `./echo&text=repeat` ERROR

get `./echo&text=1` OK!

---

### POSTer child

posting is just a different decorator

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
@hug.post('/echo')
def echo_text(text = 'Foobar'):
    return text
```

#### _yes, you can chain decorators_

---

Other goodies:

- versioning
- directives
- cli
- local

---

### I bet you can't do versions!

oh yes I can!

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo', versions=1)
def echo_text(text: hug.types.number):
    return text
```

`./v1/echo`

#### _or pass a list and its valid for multiple versions_

---

# Built in Directives

powerful path to the internals of hug but beyond scope for today

some built in directives you can use:

- Timer
- session
- user (super useful after authentication)
- CurrentAPI (use this to call same version api endpoints)

---

# Directives

I need stuff from the webserver not the client

this is a reason for directives

```python
@hug.directive()
def session(context_name='session', request=None, **kwargs):
    return request.context.get(context_name)

@hug.get('/some_endpoint')
def my_endpoint(session: hug.directives.session):
    session # is here automatically, not passed in at the api level
```

#### _session is not part of the endpoint but still passed in_

---

# Cli

```python

@hug.cli()
def echo(value):
    return {'value': value}
```

print a message about usage
`hug -f app.py -c help`

call the method from cli
`hug -f app.py -c echo hello`

---

# Local

building a library?

```python

@hug.local()
def echo(value: hug.types.number):
    return {'value': value}
```

and how to use it:

```python
from api.py import echo
echo('foo') # nice error
echo(1) # yay
```

---

# Features & Performance

- hot reloading
- single process can handle thousands of connects a second
- based on falcon
- faster than most web frameworks
- supports marshmallow serialization

---

# Live Demo

goal is an app with 3 endpoints that stores strings

- store data @ /save
- show all data @ /data
- clear data @ /clear

---

### Implementing

hug is wsgi compatible which gives you access to all the wsgi hosts

- uWSGI
- Gunicorn
- nginx

they even provide a pre built docker container for your pleasure!

---

### Real world use cases

hug hosts the api that is consumed by:

- your web page (react?)
- your phone app (java/swift)
- someone else (no need to scrape!)

### What does hug stand for?

Hopefully Useful Guide

its built help devs create intuitive well written apis

# Thanks for listening!

## now go write some apis

Dont be shy!<br/>
I consult, teach, freelance, and geek out about python.<br/>
