# What is Hug?

JSON focused webserver that is:

- Radically simple
- Self documenting
- Clean
- Performant

---

# Crazy Simple Syntax

---


this

```python
import hug

@hug.get('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'World'
```

---

becomes:

```javascript
{
  404: "The API call you tried to make was not defined...",
  documentation: {
    handlers: {
      /hello: {
        GET: {
          examples: [ "http://localhost:8000/hello" ],
          outputs: {
            format: "JSON (Javascript Serialized Object Notation)",
            content_type: "application/json; charset=utf-8"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

---

# Lets do something a little more challenging

---

Remember, leave the parsing to the framework and just do the business logic

``````python
import hug

@hug.get('/echo')
def echo_text(text):
    return text
``````

get

`http://localhost:8000/echo&text=repeat`


response

```javascript
{ "repeat" }
```
